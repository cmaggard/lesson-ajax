This is the starter code for the first Intoxicoders lesson, on AJAX and simple single-page web applications. Start here!

*Note:* You don't need to do anything before the lesson starts. However, the code sample that we'll working with is in this repository, so you're welcome to clone it and follow along. We'll be projecting the code onto the screen and explaining everything step by step, so you won't even need your laptop, but we'll leave the learning methodologies up to you. If you run into problems, wait until the end of the session and we'll help you out.

For this project, you'll need to have installed [git](http://git-scm.com) to "clone" this repository, and [node.js](http://nodejs.org) to run the application server. Once you do, get into the bash shell and enter the commands preceded by a dollar sign. (Lines not preceded by a dollar sign will resemble the output you'll get if everything's working right.)
