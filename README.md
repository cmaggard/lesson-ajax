This is the code for the first Intoxicoders lesson, on AJAX and simple single-page web applications. Start here!

You'll need to have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [Git](http://git-scm.com) installed to run me locally. 
Once you've got that, navigate to the directory I'm in on the command line and enter:

    $ node app

Open a web browser to http://localhost:3000 and you're good to go.
